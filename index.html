            Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human
             intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

            Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from
            and improve their performance on a specific task without being explicitly programmed.

            AI and machine learning have applications in various industries, including healthcare, finance, education, and manufacturing, where they
            cadatan automate processes, analyze vast amounts of data, and make predictions to enhance decision-making.

            The ethical considerations surrounding AI and machine learning involve issues such as bias in algorithms, privacy concerns, and the potential impact on employment as automation becomes more prevalent.

            s such as deep learning and neural networks contributing to the development of more sophisticated and capable intelligent systems.
