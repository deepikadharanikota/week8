        <h1>
            The widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) can have both positive and negative 
            effects on humans. On the positive side, AI has the potential to enhance efficiency, improve
            productivity, and create new opportunities in various industries. However, there are concerns
            about job displacement as automation may replace certain roles, leading to unemployment and the
            need for reskilling. Additionally, ethical considerations related to privacy, bias in algorithms,
            and the potential misuse of AI technologies raise important questions about the impact of AI on 
            societal well-being and human values.

        <h2>
            AI makes humans lazy and jobless.
